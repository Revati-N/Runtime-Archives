# Why do your eyes tear up when you yawn?
## Did you know eyes watering when yawning is not a COMMON occurrence ?

When a person yawns, depending on how forcefully they yawn or how they stretch their other facial muscles, it may put pressure on the lacrimal glands.

The lacrimal glands are glands that secrete tears, helping keep the eyes moisturized. They sit just above the eyes, under the eyebrows.

Yawns can stretch the facial muscles and the jaw, which might relieve facial tension or pain. Some people also find that their jaws click or become uncomfortable when yawning.

## Humans are NOT the only ones who YAWN:

Many animals also yawn, and in babies, yawning begins even before they are born. Though almost everyone yawns, researchers have not developed a single conclusive answer to the question of why individuals yawn.

Whether your tears come from crying, sneezing, laughing or yawning, they are often a good sign your body is taking care of you and that your eyes are working well.
